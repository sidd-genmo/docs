# Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to start generating videos with the Genmo API.

## Authentication

All API requests require an API key. Include it in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Making Your First Request

### 1. Create a Video Generation Task

Send a POST request to the `/create` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.genmo.ai/create \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A serene lake at sunset with mountains in the background",
    "model": "mochi"
  }'
```

### 2. Check Generation Status

Use the returned `taskId` to check the status:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.genmo.ai/status/task_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Handle the Result

When the status shows "completed", you can access your video at the provided `resultUrl`.

## Using Webhooks

To receive automatic updates, include a `webhookUrl` in your generation request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.genmo.ai/create \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A serene lake at sunset with mountains in the background",
    "model": "mochi",
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-domain.com/webhook"
  }'
```

Your webhook endpoint will receive status updates as the generation progresses.
